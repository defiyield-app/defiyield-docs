# Rekt Database

Striving to remain the biggest contributor to the safety of the DeFi community, DeFiYield has developed a most comprehensive database of all exploits, attacks, exit scams and other instances of projects getting 'rekt'. Our [**Rekt Database**](https://defiyield.app/rekt-database) offers a way to quickly search through these.

At the database's top section, you can see an overview of funds lost and/or recovered throughout the industry's many hacks and exploits. Choose your preferred timespan or chart type to see this information in more detail, or keep an eye out for the "Rekt of the Month" to see the most recent occurrences added to our database.

## Exploit Search

Through our Rekt Database, you can search for any project to find out if it has been exploited, rugged or has experienced any other sort of worrisome occurrence. By default, the page shows you the ranking of the exploits with the most financial impact (most funds lost):

By clicking on the 'Details' column next to any project, you can view a detailed summary of each occurrence, including the affected addresses, how the event took place, etc:

Through our various filters, you can search for a hack or exploit by name or date, as well as the following:

#### Chain

This is the blockchain where the exploit took place. In many cases, an exploit can take place in multiple chains!

#### Category

This is the category of the platform that suffered the exploit or hack. Examples include:

* NFT - Includes NFT collections as well as marketplaces.
* Bridge - Any cross-chain bridges that allow users to move from one chain to another.
* CeFi - Includes centralized exchanges or other centralized products utilizing DeFi primitives.
* DEX - Any decentralized exchange or trading platform.
* Gaming/Metaverse - Gaming-specific platforms!
* Stablecoin - Any protocol supporting a stablecoin regardless of backing.
* Token - Any ERC-20 or similar token that doesn't involve its own platform in other categories.
* Yield Aggregator - Auto-compounders, farm optimizers, etc.
* Borrowing & Lending - Lending markets such as Aave or Compound.
* Other - DAOs, insurance protocols, generic infrastructure or any other platforms that don't fit any other categories!

#### Type

This is the type of scam, exploit or hack that took place. Examples include different types of exit scams as well as exploits like reentrancy attacks, flash loans or simply access vulnerabilities.

#### Auditor

This is the auditing firm that audited the affected contracts, if any. This can be useful to view a track record of any one given auditing firm, but keep in mind that not all audits cover everything in a given protocol.
