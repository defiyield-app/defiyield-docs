# The DeFiYield Dashboard

Our dashboard is the most central element to DeFiYieldâ€™s ecosystem. Not only is it an efficient cross-chain asset management solution with a plethora of useful features, it also combines this with built-in safety infrastructure to keep users aware of the risks associated with their many assets and/or positions, along with how to handle them.

## Dashboard Tools <a href="#dashboard-tools" id="dashboard-tools"></a>

### Address Book

The [**Address Book**](address-book.md) enables you to switch between tracking any wallet or group of wallets you'd like. Connecting to new wallets, adding new ones or managing your previously added wallets is made extremely easy here.

### Wallet Balances

A quick way to see what tokens you are holding on any of your wallets, on any of our supported blockchains, is the [**Wallet**](wallet.md) page. This includes any assets currently sitting in your wallet, meaning any tokens not staked, deposited or otherwise interacting with any DeFi protocols.

### Deposited Balances

If you've deposited liquidity or staked assets anywhere, the [**Deposit**](deposit.md) page is where you'll get detailed insight into your balances along with any outstanding staking rewards.

This not only includes deposits in the hundreds of dapps we support, but also native staking, such as staking ETH on Ethereum, AVAX on Avalanche, etc.

### Lent Balances

Using a lending market to lend and borrow tokens? The [**Lending**](lending.md) page is where you'll get detailed info into what you have lent, and what you have borrowed, alongside the APRs of any of these interactions on any of our supported platforms, and any outstanding incentive rewards.

### NFT Portfolio

Your [**NFTs**](nfts.md) can easily be browsed here, regardless of what chain they are in. Info such as marketplace value, recent sales, floor price, collection details and more can be seen on the more popular collections and tradeable tokens.

### Exploring New Opportunities

If you're unsure where to deposit your funds, the [**Explore Opportunities**](explore-opportunities.md) page can help you find what pools, vaults, lending markets or otherwise interesting opportunities are available in DeFi for your assets.
