## Searching For Pools

Through our extensive listings, you can search by any criteria that is most important to you. If you are a fan of a specific network, for example, feel free to search for pools on that network exclusively, or choose your favorite multi-chain protocol to search for.

You can be as specific as you'd like. For example, you may be looking for the following:

* Stablecoin-only pool, due to your particular risk profile.
* A TVL of at least $100M, in order to really filter only for the most trusted and utilized protocols.
* Sorted by APR, to net you decent profits throughout the year.
