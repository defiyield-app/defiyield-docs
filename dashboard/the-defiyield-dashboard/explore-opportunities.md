You can be as specific as you'd like. For example, you may be looking for the following:

* Stablecoin-only pool, due to your particular risk profile.
* A TVL of at least $100M, in order to really filter only for the most trusted and utilized protocols.
* An APR of at least 8%, to net you decent profits throughout the year.
