The search bar allows you to search for any NFT via name or collection, and the filters on the right allow you to filter your portfolio by NFT collection, or sort them by price in descending or ascending order.

## Checking Out Your NFTs

By clicking on any NFT, you can view any details available for it, which will largely depend on what type of NFT you have. For popular collections, you can expect a ton of interesting info such as the item's traits, collection details, and other identifying information:

### NFT Traits

These are traits inherent to your NFT, which are usually determined when they are first minted. Some NFTs have many different traits with specific rarities to each, while some collections may offer only a couple important traits to any given piece.

Depending on the rarity of your NFT's traits, you might have a very expensive piece in your hands! The floor price of each trait will be listed in this screen, allowing to easily see what are the most sought-after traits of your token.

### Collection Info
