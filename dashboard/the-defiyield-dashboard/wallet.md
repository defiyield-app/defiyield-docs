# Wallet

Your wallet page is the easiest way to simply view all the tokens you are holding in your wallet. This means assets that are currently not interacting with any DeFi protocol, or staked in any manner.

## Checking Your Wallet

Here you can easily view any asset's price, how much of the asset you have available in your wallet as well as its calculated value in USD:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

## Adding Missing Tokens

If the page is missing some of your more obscure tokens, worry not; they can easily be added by typing in its network and address:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png>)

The other two fields should fill in automatically. If not, you may be required to input those manually, or the address you are trying to input may not be a token after all.
