# Getting Started

By using the **DeFiYield Workshop**, anyone can quickly and easily integrate a dapp (decentralized application) into DeFiYield's dashboard. If you're looking to add one of your own integrations, follow the following steps:

## Step 1 - Fork the DeFiYield Workshop Repository

Navigate to our [**code repository**](https://github.com/defiyield-app/defiyield-workshop) and click on the "Fork" button:

This will create a copy of the DeFiYield Workshop code that you can edit as you'd like.

## Step 2 - Add Your Integration

Follow our [**new integration guide**](new-integration-guide.md) to add your very own dapp to DeFiYield's dashboard. We've made this experience as streamlined as possible to allow anyone to quickly and easily make their own additions.

## Step 3 - Make a Pull Request

By making a Pull Request (PR) you are suggesting your additions to the main DeFiYield Workshop codebase. Our team can quickly review your new integration and merge your code in, or suggest some potential changes.

Make a PR by clicking on the "Contribute" button in your own repository:

When making a PR, make sure to include all relevant information such as what dapp you have integrated, what tests you added, or anything else that could make it so that your addition is reviewed as quickly as possible!
