# Getting Started

Our platform provides a multitude of utility in all aspects of DeFi, so it may be a little hard to grasp all that we offer. Here's a quick first guide to get you started:

## Step 1 - Connect Your Wallet

Through your [**address book**](../dashboard/the-defiyield-dashboard/address-book.md) or the top-left of our app, connect your wallet! We support all types of browser wallets, on a ton of different blockchains.

Alternatively, you can just tell us the address of a wallet you'd like to track through the [**address book**](../dashboard/the-defiyield-dashboard/address-book.md). You can even add multiple wallets, create unique bundles of wallets to switch to anytime.

## Step 2 - Keep Track of Your Balances

Through DeFiYield's [**Dashboard**](../dashboard/the-defiyield-dashboard/), you can easily keep track of any of your tokens, NFTs, provided liquidity or otherwise funds in any of the dozens of blockchains we support.

On your home page, you'll see a general overview of all your assets. For a more detailed look into each type of asset, refer to the 'Investment' section of our sidebar. There you will find the following:

#### Wallet Balances

A quick way to see what tokens you are holding on any of your wallets, on any of our supported blockchains, is the [**Wallet**](../dashboard/the-defiyield-dashboard/wallet.md) page. This includes any assets currently sitting in your wallet, meaning any tokens not staked, deposited or otherwise interacting with any DeFi protocols.

#### Deposited Balances

If you've deposited liquidity or staked assets anywhere, the [**Deposit**](../dashboard/the-defiyield-dashboard/deposit.md) page is where you'll get detailed insight into your balances along with any outstanding staking rewards.

This not only includes deposits in the hundreds of dapps we support, but also native staking, such as staking ETH on Ethereum, AVAX on Avalanche, etc.

#### Lent Balances

Using a lending market to lend and borrow tokens? The [**Lending**](../dashboard/the-defiyield-dashboard/lending.md) page is where you'll get detailed info into what you have lent, and what you have borrowed, alongside the APRs of any of these interactions on any of our supported platforms, and any outstanding incentive rewards.

## Step 3 - Stay Safe

At DeFiYield, we provide you with as many tools as possible to ensure you can stay informed and safe throughout your decentralized investing journey. Check them out below:

### Our Security Toolkit

#### Checking For Threats

DeFiYield's [**Shield**](../security-toolkit/shield.md) page can quickly scan your wallet addresses to see if you have interacted with any at-risk smart contracts, and if you have any exposure to possible exploits.

These can include a ton of different events, such as an ERC-20 approval given to a high-risk contract, funds in a contract that can be upgraded without a timelock or multi-sig, etc. Our scanner will catch these all and let you know how to deal with any potentially risky scenario.

#### Scanning Smart Contracts

Through our [**Scanner**](../security-toolkit/scanner.md), you can quickly scan any smart contract to ensure it is safe to use, which is especially important if the contract hasn't been audited.

### Our Databases

Before investing in any DeFi protocol, you should definitely give it a search in our databases:

#### Audit Database

Making sure a project has been thoroughly audited is the first step to investing safely in DeFi.

Our [**Audit Database**](../audits/audit-database.md) will let you know if that protocol has been audited in the past. Not only that, but it will tell you when it was audited, by whom, the coverage of the audit and give you unrestricted access to the audit report itself.

#### Rekt Database

In the wild west of DeFi, it is important to keep track of the exploits that occur in order to be able to prevent them in the future.

Our [**Rekt Database**](../audits/rekt-database.md) does exactly that. Also check if the protocol you want to invest in has a history of exploits in their smart contracts, or if the auditing firm that performed its audit hasn't had a ton of exploits on its audited contracts.
